# AI Google Calendar Agent

A simple AI-powered assistant that lets you manage your Google Calendar using natural language commands.

## Features

- Create, update, move, delete calendar events
- List upcoming events
- Authenticate securely with Google using OAuth2
- Understands plain English instructions via AI

## Setup

1. **Create Google API credentials**

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Create a project and enable Google Calendar API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app)
   - Download `credentials.json` and place it in the project folder

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install langchain-google-community langchain google-auth-oauthlib
````

3. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   python CALENDAR.py
   ```

   On first run, a browser window will open for Google authentication.

## Usage

Type natural language commands like:

```
Create a green event for a 30-minute run this afternoon.
Delete my meeting tomorrow at 2 PM.
Show me my events for next week.
```

The agent will interact with your Google Calendar accordingly.

## Notes

* This is a learning project to demonstrate AI + Google API integration.
